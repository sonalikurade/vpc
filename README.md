# Difference between Security group and Network control access list (NACL)
Comparison: VPC Security Group vs NACL in AWS.

## Security Group

Is the firewall of EC2 Instances

## Network ACL

Is the firewall of the VPC Subnets

### Key Differences: Security group vs NACL
### Scope: Subnet or Instance (where to apply)
* Security Groups operate at the Instance (Network Interface) level. Security Group has to be assigned explicitly to the instance.

* Network ACLs at the subnet level. Applies automatically to all instances deployed in the associated subnet.

### State: Stateful or Stateless
* Security groups are stateful. Return traffic is allowed, regardless of the rules.

* e.g. If you allow an incoming traffic on port 80, the outgoing traffic on port 80 will be automatically allowed.

* Network ACLs are stateless. Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by the rules. This means any changes applied to an incoming rule will not be applied to an outgoing rule.

* e.g. If you allow an incoming port 80, you would also need to apply the rule for outgoing traffic.

### Rule Type: Allow or Deny
* Security group supports allow rules only (everything else is denied implicitly). You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.

* e.g. You cannot deny a certain IP address from establishing a connection.

* Network ACL supports allow and deny rules.

* e.g. By deny rules, you could explicitly deny a certain IP address to establish a connection to an EC2 Instance.

### Rule Process order
* The security group evaluates all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic.

* (When you associate multiple security groups with a resource, the rules from each security group are aggregated to form a single set of rules that are used to determine whether to allow access.)

* Network ACL evaluates rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, when deciding whether to allow traffic.

* If a matching rule is found during evaluation, the remaining rules wonâ€™t be evaluated.

### Occurrence
* Instances can have multiple Security groups.

* A subnet can have only one NACL.

### Rule Destination
* Security group rule allows CIDR, IP, and Security Group as destinations.

* The network ACL rule only allows CIDR as a destination.

### Defense order
* A security group is the first layer of defense, whereas Network ACL is the second layer of defense for outbound/egress traffic.

* Network ACL is the first layer of defense, whereas the Security group is the second layer of defense for inbound/ingress traffic.

* Consider creating Network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups, to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
